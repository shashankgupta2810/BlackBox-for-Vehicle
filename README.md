In this work, we have proposed a smart black box for a vehicle that shall determine the cause
of accidents based on the driving conditions and the level of driverâ€™s fatigue. In addition to this,
the system shall also determine the location of the accident and initiate an emergency action
plan by informing emergency services like ambulance and hospital, police, insurance
companies, etc. The cause of the accident is determined using various sensors. The sensors
used are temperature, humidity, fire, accelerometer, and module used are GPS and GSM. The
signal from the sensors shall be used as feature vectors which shall be used to predict the exact
cause of the accident. The pre-trained model shall be used for fatigue detection however a
separate model shall be trained to determine the cause of the accident. This system shall also
monitor how when and where a vehicle is being driven and provide an analysis as feedback to
the driver. The driving behaviour can also be predicted depending on the speed, use of the seat
belt, and severity of the crash. It is proposed that this system shall reduce the response time
required for emergency services as well as help in fair claim settlements arising out of the
damage caused in the accident.
